When applied to university, I wanted to make a beautiful resume. <br> 
You can simply download the pattern and change it for yourself, but I decided to refresh my knowledge in web technologies and to create pdf resume on my own. <br>
So, I:
 - made a web page based on reference example, that I found on the internet (cause I'm not a good designer)
 - converted this page to pdf with <a href='https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html' target='_blank'>wkhtmltox tool</a> and pdfkit (python library)
