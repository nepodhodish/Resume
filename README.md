# Resume
A place for my relevant projects and important awards

### Brief description:
- I started programming when I was 13. My first language was python (and still is my favourite).
- Then I added Web technologies to my education process (like html, css and javascript).
- At the age of 15 I got interested in lineral algebra and artificial intellegence.
- A bit later I entered 'machine' and 'deep' learning courses that broaded my mind in this domain as I wanted.
- Simultaneously with these events, I had some success in school olympiads.
- The last year in my high school I participated in a National Technological Olympiade in Artificial Intellegence and got to the final.
- Nowadays I have remembered how to do pretty web pages in order to make my pdf resume.
