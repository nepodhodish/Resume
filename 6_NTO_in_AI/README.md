Last year our assignments were based on short videos. <br>
In the pre-final we did "video captioning". I coped with it quite well.<br>
In the final we encounted with "video questioning and answering" and this task seemed harder compairing with the previous one. <br>
However, I have never been in such extreme situation when you need to find out the solutions in the lack of time. <br> 
I was incredible experience!
